# Usage
The app uses the swedish police api polisen.se/api/event
and shows a list of places that something has occured.
a user can also search for places.

Click on one of those places and markers will show on the map.
markers will be placed for the selected place and places in the nearby area where something has happend.
There is a popup for each marker that will show/hide if the user clicks on them.

once a place has been selected or the user has made a seach each event will be showed as single cards on the right side of the map.
